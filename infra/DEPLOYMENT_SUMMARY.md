# Terraform Configuration Summary

## Available Configuration Files ✅

Your Event Grid blob trigger infrastructure now supports both public and private access modes through separate configuration files:

### 📁 Configuration Files Created

| File | Purpose | Use Case | Monthly Cost |
|------|---------|----------|--------------|
| `terraform.tfvars.example` | Template with all variables | Copy and customize | - |
| `terraform.tfvars.private` | **Private Access Mode** | Production, high security | ~$150-200 |
| `terraform.tfvars.public` | **Public Access Mode** | Development, testing | ~$50-75 |

### 🔒 Private Access Mode (`terraform.tfvars.private`)
- ✅ Private endpoints for Storage Account and Function App
- ✅ VNet integration for secure connectivity
- ✅ Azure Bastion and jumpbox VM for management
- ✅ Network restrictions (deny public access)
- ✅ Maximum security posture
- 💰 Higher cost (~$150-200/month)

### 🌐 Public Access Mode (`terraform.tfvars.public`)
- ✅ Public endpoints for simplified connectivity
- ✅ No private networking components
- ✅ Easy development access
- ✅ Lower cost for testing environments
- 💰 Lower cost (~$50-75/month)

## 🚀 Quick Deployment Commands

### Deploy Private Mode (Production)
```bash
cd infra
terraform init
terraform plan -var-file="terraform.tfvars.private"
terraform apply -var-file="terraform.tfvars.private"
```

### Deploy Public Mode (Development)
```bash
cd infra
terraform init
terraform plan -var-file="terraform.tfvars.public"
terraform apply -var-file="terraform.tfvars.public"
```

### Switch Between Modes
```bash
# Switch to private mode
terraform apply -var-file="terraform.tfvars.private"

# Switch to public mode  
terraform apply -var-file="terraform.tfvars.public"
```

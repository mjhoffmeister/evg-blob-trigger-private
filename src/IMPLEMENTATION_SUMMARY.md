# Azure Function App Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed Implementation

I have successfully created a .NET 8.0 Azure Function App in the `src` folder that meets all your requirements:

### üéØ Core Functions Created

#### 1. **ProcessBlobEvents** (Event Hub Trigger)
- **File**: `BlobEventFunction.cs`
- **Trigger**: Event Hub named `evh-evgblobpvt-westus2`
- **Purpose**: Processes blob creation events from Event Grid via Event Hub
- **Features**:
  - Parses Event Grid events from Event Hub messages
  - Extracts blob name and container from blob URLs
  - Structured logging with OpenTelemetry integration
  - Custom scoped logging with correlation data (blob URL, size, event ID)
  - Error handling for JSON parsing and processing failures

#### 2. **HealthCheck** (HTTP Trigger)
- **File**: `HealthCheckFunction.cs`
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/health`
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive health check with JSON response
- **Response**: Status, timestamp, version, and environment information

#### 3. **Ping** (HTTP Trigger)
- **File**: `HealthCheckFunction.cs`
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/ping`
- **Purpose**: Simple availability check
- **Response**: Plain text "pong"

### üîß Technical Implementation

#### **OpenTelemetry Integration**
- **File**: `Program.cs`
- Integrated Azure Monitor OpenTelemetry for Application Insights
- Automatic telemetry collection for comprehensive observability
- Structured logging with correlation data

#### **Project Configuration**
- **File**: `BlobEventProcessor.csproj`
- .NET 8.0 target framework
- Azure Functions v4 runtime
- Isolated worker process model
- Updated package dependencies with resolved version conflicts

#### **Event Processing Flow**
1. Blob created in Azure Storage
2. Event Grid captures the blob creation event
3. Event forwarded to Event Hub (`evh-evgblobpvt-westus2`)
4. Function App processes event from Event Hub
5. Structured logging to Application Insights via OpenTelemetry

### üìÅ Files Created/Modified

```

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ BlobEventFunction.cs        # Main event processing function
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ HealthCheckFunction.cs      # HTTP health check endpoints
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Program.cs                  # Application startup with OpenTelemetry

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                   # Documentation and usage guide
```

### üîó Required Configuration

#### **Connection Strings Needed**
1. **EventHubConnection**: Event Hub namespace connection string
2. **APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING**: Application Insights telemetry endpoint

#### **Local Development**
- Empty Application Insights connection string for local testing
- Development storage for local Azure Functions runtime
- Placeholder Event Hub connection (replace with actual values)

### üöÄ Ready for Deployment

#### **Build Status**: ‚úÖ Successfully compiled
- All package dependencies resolved
- No compilation errors
- Function metadata generated correctly

#### **Deployment Ready**
The Function App is ready to be deployed to Azure and will work with the infrastructure created by your Terraform configuration (both public and private modes).

### üîç Key Features Implemented

- **Structured Logging**: Logs blob name, container, event details with correlation data
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for Event Hub message parsing
- **Health Monitoring**: HTTP endpoints for application health verification
- **OpenTelemetry**: Full observability with Application Insights integration
- **Modern Architecture**: .NET 8.0 isolated worker model with latest best practices

### üîÑ Integration with Infrastructure

The Function App is designed to work seamlessly with your Terraform infrastructure:
- Event Hub trigger connects to `evh-evgblobpvt-westus2` from your Terraform config
- OpenTelemetry sends data to Application Insights (publicly accessible in both modes)
- Works with both public and private access mode configurations

This implementation provides a robust, production-ready solution for processing blob events with comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities.
